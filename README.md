2. Unzip the file and load the unzipped folder from within Logseq.
3. Restart Logseq.

# Usage

After restarting Logseq, trigger the plugin by typing `/MathLive`. A dialogue box will appear to let you enter your Mathematical functions. An output property will also be created to store the math values so that the block is able to persist the typed equation.
